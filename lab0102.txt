i = 3 squared = 9
i = 4 squared = 16
i = 5 squared = 25
i = 6 squared = 36
i = 7 squared = 49
i = 8 squared = 64
i = 9 squared = 81

Fun!
Press any key continue...

2A) 10 is now included as an accepted value for i and is therefore run through the process of listing the numbers and it's value when squared.
2b) There are no spaces between each outputs. All the outputs are displayed in a single line.
2c) Instead of the i value increasing by one, it increses by two with each repetition

A + is an arithmetic operator, whereas ++ is an increment operator. This means when there is only + it will look for a "primary expression" 
(aka a second value) to add. The ++ is used to signify that it should increment by one without needing a value to add to i.

13	20	N:\SYDE121\Lab 0101\lab0101.cpp	[Error] expected ';' before ')' token

The semicolon is required to close the line, which then executes the for loop. Since the line is not closed, the for loop does not execute and therefore
we got an error message.

6	21	N:\SYDE121\Lab 0101\lab0101.cpp	[Error] iostream: No such file or directory

The space between "<" and "iostream" is added to the front of the iostream directory name, making C++ call upon " iostream". Since " iostream" does 
not exist in the directory, the file being called upon couldn't be found and the compiler gave us the errror.
