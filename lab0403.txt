a)What is the largest value of n that the program can correctly handle?

The largest value of n the program can correctly handle was 12. 13! = 6,227,020,800 but the maximum value of unsigned int is 4,292,967,295. 

b)What happens when the program breaks?

The numbers generated were no longer accurate. 

c) What is the largest value of n that program can correctly handle if 'unsigned int' was changed to 'int'

The largest value of n the program can correctly handle was also 12. 13! = 6,227,020,800 but the maximum value of int is 2,147,483,647.
